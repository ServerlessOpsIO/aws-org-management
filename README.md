# aws-org-management

AWS organization account management

This repository provides resources to be deployed to accounts across the AWS organization. This is typically configuration small enough to not ned its own separate repository. This repo is primarily made up of Cloudformation StackSets that are deployed to the organization management account and deployed to organization accounts via the Cloudformation StackSet process.
